# Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
#   Definition: paradigm or coding style
#   Paradigm:   structuring a programm so the Methods (Functions) and Attributes (Data or Property)
#               are bundled into Objects
#   Methods:    act as Fuction that use the information of the Object
#   Attributes: act as Object properties
#   Class:      template for creating Objects (Object constructor or Blueprint)
#   - OOP allows to organize code and make it readable und reusable
#
# Programming languages paradigms: (OOP, Procedual, Functional)
#   Procedual:  structure app like recipe, sets the steps to make the task
#   Functional: built on the concept of mathematical functions
#
# Python supports multi-language paradigms and consequently supports OOP
# Everything in Python is an object
