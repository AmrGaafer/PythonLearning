# Virtual Environment:  Environment that holds the pre-required packages for the project
#   Conventions:
#       the folder holding the virtual environments is called 'envs'
#       inside this folder create a folder for each virtual environment (eg. ai)
#   Syntax: [in terminal] after changing the working directory to 'envs': python -m venv ai
#   Dirctory: ...\envs\ai\Lib\site-packages:    holds the packages of the virtual environment
#   Dirctory: ...\envs\ai\Scripts:              holds the opertating files
#
#   Activate a virtual environment:
#       Syntax: [in terminal] source .ai\Scripts\activate
#       to browse the modules inside the virtual environment after activation use pip list
#
#   Deactivate a virtual environment:
#       Syntax: [in terminal] deactivate
#
#   NOTE: [in terminal] which python: shows which python is running currently
#
#   Run file with python from virtual environment:
#       Syntax: [in terminal] ai\Scripts\python
